# anthropic-exercise
Take-home assessment for Applied AI Engineer interview with Anthropic.

All my analysis was done within nba_project.ipynb

Make sure to create a .env file with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_key>

As I went through the analysis, I iterated over what was previously written as thoughts came to me, meaning that I override variables. For the best experience, I would just "run all". Some steps might take 10+ minutes to run, as I iterated over the entire ground_truth_data.json object to evaluate the performance as accurately as I could. 

You should only need the anthropic and the dotenv package.
